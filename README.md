# PN532Killer C-Interface

Attempt to port [pn532-python](https://github.com/whywilson/pn532-python) interface
to C in order to be compatible with a broader range of applications.

This is just a simple prototype and currently only implements HF15 commands,
as I personally needed it. Feeld free to fork and improve.

Test code is in pn532_test.c
